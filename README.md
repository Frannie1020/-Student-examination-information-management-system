1.1 Analysis of basic functional requirements

Student achievement management system, need to achieve find, add, delete, sort and other functions, so as to achieve the output of student information about the function.

The student performance management system needs to have a student information, management system category. 

The student information category includes the student's name, student number, class number, grades, gender, etc.

The password, name grades can be added, deleted and modified, but this can only be done in administrator mode. 

Within this class there are statistics on class averages and the number of failures, the ability to add, delete, sort and other student information within the class and perform input and output modes such as search. There is also a file read option, exit, continue input, and the ability to input around 100,000.
